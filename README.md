This project demonstrates a successful implementation of a deep learning model for image classification using TensorFlow. The model was trained and evaluated on the CIFAR-10 dataset, showcasing the steps of data loading, preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation. Despite the model achieving a certain level of accuracy, the constant validation loss suggests potential overfitting, indicating areas for further optimization and improvement.
